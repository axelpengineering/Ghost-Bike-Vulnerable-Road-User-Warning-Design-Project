# Ghost-Bike-Vulnerable-Road-User-Warning-Design-Project
Designed a solution to intersection violence at St.George and Bloor. Project uses memorial aspects, sound and visual cues to encourage vulnerable road users (pedestrians) to practice safer behaviours at intersections. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II.

**Highlights**
- **Produced a Prototype:** Scaled down version with geometric representations of selected components.
- **Presented Ideas:** The team conducted a 15 minute presentation assessing how our model performed against our chosen key performance indicators.
- **Generated Alternative Solutions:** Developed quite distinguished alternative design solutions all feasible. Ultimately the other ones could have been their own projects.

## Results
**Outcomes of the experience**
- Learned how to undergo engineering documentation.
- Learned how to proffessionally communicate with the client and to an engineering manager.
- Learned about industry practices including status reports, using gantt charts conducting research and referencing.

**Outcomes of the design**
- Design had seemless integration into the intersection, making it non-distracting to drivers.
- Sound cues were sufficient to alert pedestrians of danger.
- Visual cues were sufficient to alert pedestrians of danger.
- Memorialization aspect capable to inspire safer behaviours in pedestrians.
- Outlined potential changes for future iterations: More environmental resistant designs, more sustainably built parts.
