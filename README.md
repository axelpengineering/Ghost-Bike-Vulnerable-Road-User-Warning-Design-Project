# Ghost-Bike-Vulnerable-Road-User-Warning-Design-Project
Designed a solution to intersection violence at St.George and Bloor. Project uses memorial aspects, sound and visual cues to encourage vulnerable road users (pedestrians) to practice safer behaviours at intersections. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II.

**Highlights**
- **Produced a Prototype:** Scaled down version with geometric representations of selected components.
- **Low Cost:** Constrained below $20,000, with robot arms for cinema  typically being priced $100K-$500K.
- **Large Range of Motion:** Due to Roomba inspired base design, the arm is able to move virutally anywhere within the area assuming it is flat.
